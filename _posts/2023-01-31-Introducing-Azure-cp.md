Hi Everyone!!!
    Today, I will be talking about Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. Some years ago, if I remeber correctly, in 2021, I started working with Microsoft's Cloud Platform and it has being an exciting journey since and today, I will be sharing the fundamentals of Azure with respect to other public cloud offerings like AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, Linode and Oracle Cloud.

 So What is Microsoft Azure?
  Simply put, Microsoft Azure is a Public Cloud offering built by Microsoft and its microsoft's response to creating massive computing, storage and networking systems so users can run their workloads seamlessly without paying upfront or paying heavily to provision any of the resource for building testing or deploying their workloads.

  
Thats it for now. In my next post, I would be talking about my experience in the OMP Mentorship.

Bye.
