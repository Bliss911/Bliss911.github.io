Hi!
Today, I would be talking about my goals and aspirations for the HNG Internship.

Initially when the registrations began, I never wanted to signup for this years HNGi8 program. I had earlier participated in the 
just concluded Zuri (https://training.zuri.team/) Internship where I wasn't able to  make it to the 5th stage. It wasn't easy for me back then because I was working on my DevOps career, courses and also working on my final year studies coupled with my final Year project.
Although I am done with school now, I can no longer participate because the program has ended.

I want to build my skills in DevOps Engineering. This has been my goal since this year and although it wasn't my intention in joining the
HNGi8 program, I just wanted to meet people and exchange connections. But then DevOps track was included.
I was excited and I want to maximise the opportunity in becoming world class DevOps Engineer.

If selected into the DevOps track, it would be a great opportunity for me to work and learn more in DevOps Engineering . By the End of the 8 weeks internship program, I want to have improved in my DevOps Engineering skills and experience.

This journey is going to be a great one and I would be putting down links to beginner tutorials:

If you are an aspiring UI/UX designer, checkout this [beginners tutorial to Figma](https://www.vandelaydesign.com/figma-tutorials/)

For developers both mobile and web the knowledge of git is super important. Checkout this Tutorial by [Javapoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/git) on Git.

Tutorial link to begin learning python for beginners I would recommend:
[https://www.w3schools.com/python/](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).

The Zuri team has a very complete site for a lot of courses ranging from Cloud to Web development, and also Mobile development. Checkout their useful resources [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).
