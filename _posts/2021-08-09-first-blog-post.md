Hi!
 My name is Innocent (or you can call me Cious). I am a DevOps Engineer with 3 years experience and specialty in Automation and Infrastructure. I also build Backend Web applications using Laravel framework. This is my first blog post and here I would be writing a bit about myself.

 I am a Computer Engineering Student. I had graduated from the Department of Computer Science in 2018. I love to build APIs, and also love to solve problems as I encounter them.
 I am currently a mentee at the Linux Foundation Mentorship (Community Bridge) under The Open Mainframe Project. I am working under the Polycephaly Project, as a DevOps Engineer, this time on the Mainframe.

 A little bit about Polycephaly.
   The Polycephaly project is a Project which creates a design and build system for applications on z/OS. Polycephaly adopts a DevOps approach in application development and deployment where any developer, whether COBOL(v4 or v6), Java, Groovy, Python etc, can simply build their application and deploy to the Mainframe without focusing on the deployment process and underlying complexity involved in deploying your code to the mainframe. This Project was built singly by Mr. Jerry Edgington (My Mentor).

Thats it for now. In my next post, I would be talking about my experience in the OMP Mentorship.

Bye.
