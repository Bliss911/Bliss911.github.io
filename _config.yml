# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#                  
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,                    
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.                  
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible                 
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
