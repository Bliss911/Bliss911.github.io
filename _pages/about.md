My name is Innocent (or you can call me Cious). I am a DevOps Engineer with 3+ years experience and specialty in Automation and Infrastructure. I also build Backend Web applications using Laravel framework.

 I am a Computer Engineering Student. I had graduated from the Department of Computer Science in 2018. I love to build APIs, and also love to solve problems as I encounter them.
